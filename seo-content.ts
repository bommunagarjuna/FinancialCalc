Whether you are planning to take a home loan, car loan, or personal loan, our EMI calculator provides a clear picture of your monthly financial commitment.',
    explanation: {
        title: 'How is EMI Calculated?',
        content: 'The formula used to calculate EMI is: E = P x r x (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n - 1), where E is the EMI, P is the principal loan amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the loan tenure in months. Our calculator simplifies this complex calculation for you, providing instant and accurate results.'

    faq: [
      {
        question: 'What is an Equated Monthly Installment (EMI)?',
        answer: 'An EMI is a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. EMIs are used to pay off both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan is paid off in full.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How does loan tenure affect my EMI?',
        answer: 'A longer loan tenure reduces your monthly EMI amount, making it more affordable. However, a longer tenure also means you pay more interest over the life of the loan. Conversely, a shorter tenure increases your EMI but reduces the total interest paid.'

        title: 'Understanding the Calculation Method',
        content: 'The calculation is based on a simple interest formula for periods within a year, which is then compounded at the end of each year. For example, if you borrow ₹1,00,000 at 2% per month, you accrue ₹2,000 of interest each month. At the end of the year, the total interest of ₹24,000 is added to the principal, making the new principal ₹1,24,000 for the next year.'
